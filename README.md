# Sound-Adjuster
Do you use music to stay in the zone while you're working?  If you get distracted, this chrome extension will give you a gentle nudge to get back on track.  Instead of outright blocking access to a list of sites, this extension just mutes your (streaming) music if you visit one of them.  Want the music back?  Just get rid of the distractions.

This extension relies on Chrome's experimental tab-muting feature.  Go to chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting, click "enable" under "Enable Tab Audio Muting UI", and restart Chrome.

Then download these files, go to chrome://extensions, make sure "Developer Mode" is checked, click on "Load unpacked extensions" and get this one.  It should pop up on the list - check "enable" and enjoy.
