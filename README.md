# Sound-Adjuster
Do you use music to stay in the zone while you're working?  This chrome extension will use your music-addiction to give you a gentle nudge if you get distracted.  Whereas other productivity apps block sites outright, this one just mutes your (streaming) music if you visit a site on your list.  Want the music back?  Just close out the distraction.

This extension relies on Chrome's experimental tab-muting feature.  Go to chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting, click "enable" under "Enable Tab Audio Muting UI", and restart Chrome.

Then download these files, go to chrome://extensions, make sure "Developer Mode" is checked, click on "Load unpacked extensions" and get this one.  It should pop up on the list - check "enable" and enjoy.
