# Sound-Adjuster
a productivity-enhancing chrome extension

Use music to stay in the zone while you're working?  If you get distracted, this chrome extension will give you a gentle nudge to get back on track.  Instead of outright blocking access to a list of sites, this extension just mutes your (streaming) music if you visit one of them.  Want the music back?  Then get back on task.

To get this to work, you'll need to enable chrome's experimental tab-muting feature.  [Go here](chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting), click "enable" under "Enable Tab Audio Muting UI", and restart chrome.

Then
  download this bunch of files
  go to chrome://extensions
  make sure "Developer Mode" is checked
  Click on "Load unpacked extensions" and find this one.
  Click enable.
  Enjoy!
