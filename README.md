# Petrified of Silence

This chrome extension uses your addiction to music to give you a gentle nudge you if you get distracted while working.  Whereas other productivity apps block sites outright, this one just mutes your (streaming) music if you visit a site on your black-list. Then you start thinking about your bills, your ex, your deadlines, and then you think that... maybe you'll just get back to work.  The music comes back on when you close out the offending website.

This extension relies on Chrome's experimental tab-muting feature.  To use it, go to chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting, click "enable" under "Enable Tab Audio Muting UI", and restart Chrome.

Then download these files, go to chrome://extensions, make sure "Developer Mode" is checked, click on "Load unpacked extensions" and get this one.  It should then pop up on the list. Check "enable" and enjoy.

Finally, you can [listen to Alanis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHvb9V8Yzs#t=3m1s).
